        <h2 class="news">MARCH 16, 2010</h2>
        <p class="section-1">From big pieces of garbage to invisible chemicals, a wide range of pollutants ends up in
            our planet's lakes, rivers, streams, groundwater, and eventually the oceans. Water pollution—along with
            drought, inefficiency, and an exploding population—has contributed to a freshwater crisis, threatening the
            sources we rely on for drinking water and other critical needs.</p>

        <p class="section-0">Water pollution causes</p>
        <p class="section-1">Water pollution can come from a variety of sources. Pollution can enter water directly,
            through both legal and illegal discharges from factories, for example, or imperfect water treatment plants.
            Spills and leaks from oil pipelines or hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations can degrade water
            supplies. Wind, storms, and littering—especially of plastic waste—can also send debris into waterways.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Thanks largely to decades of regulation and legal action against big polluters, the main
            cause of U.S. water quality problems is now "nonpoint source pollution," when pollutants are carried across
            or through the ground by rain or melted snow. Such runoff can contain fertilizers, pesticides, and
            herbicides from farms and homes; oil and toxic chemicals from roads and industry; sediment; bacteria from
            livestock; pet waste; and other pollutants.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Finally, drinking water pollution can happen via the pipes themselves if the water is not
            properly treated, as happened in the case of lead contamination in Flint, Michigan, and other towns. Another
            drinking water contaminant, arsenic, can come from naturally occurring deposits but also from industrial
            waste.</p>

        <p class="section-0">Freshwater pollution effects</p>
        <p class="section-1">Water pollution can result in human health problems, poisoned wildlife, and long-term
            ecosystem damage. When agricultural and industrial runoff floods waterways with excess nutrients such as
            nitrogen and phosphorus, these nutrients often fuel algae blooms that then create dead zones, or low-oxygen
            areas where fish and other aquatic life can no longer thrive.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Algae blooms can create health and economic effects for humans, causing rashes and other
            ailments, while eroding tourism revenue for popular lake destinations thanks to their unpleasant looks and
            odors. High levels of nitrates in water from nutrient pollution can also be particularly harmful to infants,
            interfering with their ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and potentially causing "blue baby syndrome."
            The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 38 percent of the European Union's water
            bodies are under pressure from agricultural pollution.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Globally, unsanitary water supplies also exact a health toll in the form of disease. At
            least 2 billion people drink water from sources contaminated by feces, according to the World Health
            Organization, and that water may transmit dangerous diseases such as cholera and typhoid.</p>

        <p class="section-0">Freshwater pollution solutions</p>
        <p class="section-1">In many countries, regulations have restricted industry and agricultural operations from
            pouring pollutants into lakes, streams, and rivers, while treatment plants make our drinking water safe to
            consume. Researchers are working on a variety of other ways to prevent and clean up pollution. National
            Geographic grantee Africa Flores, for example, has created an artificial intelligence algorithm to better
            predict when algae blooms will happen. A number of scientists are looking at ways to reduce and cleanup
            plastic pollution.</p>
        <p class="section-1">There have been setbacks, however. Regulation of pollutants is subject to changing
            political winds, as has been the case in the United States with the loosening of environmental protections
            that prevented landowners from polluting the country's waterways.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Anyone can help protect watersheds by disposing of motor oil, paints, and other toxic
            products properly, keeping them off pavement and out of the drain. Be careful about what you flush or pour
            down the sink, as it may find its way into the water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends
            using phosphate-free detergents and washing your car at a commercial car wash, which is required to properly
            dispose of wastewater. Green roofs and rain gardens can be another way for people in built environments to
            help restore some of the natural filtering that forests and plants usually provide.</p>
