    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="news">MAY 15, 2010</h2>
        <p class="section-1">Land pollution is a serious problem that impacts humans, animals, and the earth. Without
            taking measures now to reduce pollution levels, permanent changes to the land can occur. The adverse changes
            to the environment due to land pollution are subtle, but the problem is much bigger than it appears.</p>

        <p class="section-0">What Is Land Pollution?</p>
        <p class="section-1">The basic definition of land pollution is the destruction and contamination of the land
            through the direct and indirect actions of humans. The pollution results in changes to the land, such as
            soil erosion. Some of the changes are irreversible, while others are not.</p>
        <p class="section-1">The effects of land pollution do not necessarily appear overnight. It is the result of
            long-term destruction from human activities. For instance, the damage from chemicals from an oil spill can
            take months or even years to be fully realized.</p>

        <p class="section-0">Causes of Land Pollution</p>
        <p class="section-1">Water pollution can result in human health problems, poisoned wildlife, and long-term
            ecosystem damage. When agricultural and industrial runoff floods waterways with excess nutrients such as
            nitrogen and phosphorus, these nutrients often fuel algae blooms that then create dead zones, or low-oxygen
            areas where fish and other aquatic life can no longer thrive.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Algae blooms can create health and economic effects for humans, causing rashes and other
            ailments, while eroding tourism revenue for popular lake destinations thanks to their unpleasant looks and
            odors. High levels of nitrates in water from nutrient pollution can also be particularly harmful to infants,
            interfering with their ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and potentially causing "blue baby syndrome."
            The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 38 percent of the European Union's water
            bodies are under pressure from agricultural pollution.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Globally, unsanitary water supplies also exact a health toll in the form of disease. At
            least 2 billion people drink water from sources contaminated by feces, according to the World Health
            Organization, and that water may transmit dangerous diseases such as cholera and typhoid.</p>

        <p class="section-0">Freshwater pollution solutions</p>
        <p class="section-1">In many countries, regulations have restricted industry and agricultural operations from
            pouring pollutants into lakes, streams, and rivers, while treatment plants make our drinking water safe to
            consume. Researchers are working on a variety of other ways to prevent and clean up pollution. National
            Geographic grantee Africa Flores, for example, has created an artificial intelligence algorithm to better
            predict when algae blooms will happen. A number of scientists are looking at ways to reduce and cleanup
            plastic pollution.</p>
        <p class="section-1">There have been setbacks, however. Regulation of pollutants is subject to changing
            political winds, as has been the case in the United States with the loosening of environmental protections
            that prevented landowners from polluting the country's waterways.</p>
        <p class="section-1">Anyone can help protect watersheds by disposing of motor oil, paints, and other toxic
            products properly, keeping them off pavement and out of the drain. Be careful about what you flush or pour
            down the sink, as it may find its way into the water. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends
            using phosphate-free detergents and washing your car at a commercial car wash, which is required to properly
            dispose of wastewater. Green roofs and rain gardens can be another way for people in built environments to
            help restore some of the natural filtering that forests and plants usually provide.</p>
